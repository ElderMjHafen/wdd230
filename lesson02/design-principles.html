            <p>The IGN site has the results set align in a grid design. They are related by being
                made or published by the same company called Capcom. Some of these games are apart
                of the same series.

            <p>The white text contrast well with the blackground on this page. You can read this
                sentence clearly and understand the pitch of the game to protential buyers.
                Although, the link to their store overlaps with the tittle of the subject.
